  "aboutDescription": "I hold a double major in Electronics and Telecommunications. I also hold two Masters, in Industrial Engineering from Argentina and in BI & Analytics from Germany. I work as a Sr. Solution Consultant in Ai and Analytics at OpenText, a world leader in Content Management. I have extensive experience leading projects and I have occupied Senior positions in big tech companies. On many occasions I coordinate multiple cross-functional teams to meet project deadlines. Leading is part of my character but I also enjoy working independently solving problems. Day by day I built up stronger my skills in Analytics and Data Science as a PhD candidate at my hometown University UNC. Persistent and relentless I am perusing my dream to become a doctor. My hobbies are retro computing, ride my bicycle long distances, and long walks in the forest. Now I am living in the south of Germany enjoying the challenges of living in a different culture and learning a new language. ",
